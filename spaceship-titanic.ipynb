On its maiden voyage transporting around 13000 emigrants to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars, at around Alpha Centauri (~4 lys away), it has collided with a spacetime anomaly which has transported half of the passengers to an alternate dimension. In this \"Getting Started\" competition, we are tasked with predicting which passengers were transported (and which weren't) using records left in the spaceship's damaged computer system.\n","\n","## Evaluation\n","\n","Submissions are evaluated based on their [classification accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy), the percentage of predicted labels that are correct. Accuracy is defined generally as:\n","\n","$Accuracy = \\frac{\\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\\text{Total number of predictions}}$\n","\n","or in the case of binary classification:\n","\n","$Accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$\n","\n","where (T,F): True/False and (P,N): Positive/Negative\n","\n","## Data\n","### Training set: train.csv\n","Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.\n","* PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\n","* HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\n","* CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\n","* Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\n","* Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\n","* Age - The age of the passenger.\n","* VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\n","* RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\n","* Name - The first and last names of the passenger.\n","* **Transported** - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n","\n","### Test set: test.csv\n","Personal records for the remaining one-third (~4300) of the passengers, to be used as test data.\n","\n","### Submission: sample_submission.csv\n","A submission file in the correct format.\n","* PassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\n","* Transported - The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.\n","\n","## Disclaimer\n","I will be working on this notebook over the coming weeks, with the evential aim of implementing a keras/tensorflow deep learning classification architechture to make the predictions, as covered in the [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) Kaggle-learn course. Along the way, I would be using lessons learnt in other Kaggle courses, like [Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) and [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering). In the end I hope this notebook will provide a guide in taking us through a complete journey in deep learning starting from basics like data loading and preparation all the way to making competitive predictions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"97b4c4b7","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009662,"end_time":"2022-12-22T14:25:21.523823","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-12-22T14:25:21.514161","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#
